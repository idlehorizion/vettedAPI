# week4.day2.vettedAPIs

## Instructions
1. You’ll be tasked with creating a website that uses at least 2 APIs to gather and display information to the user. The purpose of the website is to do something that is completely useless!
   - For example: my website asks the user for a question as input. When the user submits the question, the website displays the question along with “The answer is…” and instead of actually answering the question displays a string of 5 random words (Wordnik API), converted into “Yoda-speak” (Yoda Translation API) along with a random giphy (Giphy API).
2. Take ~10 minutes to explore the following APIs. Note: you may have to sign up to acquire an API key for some of these:
   - [Google Static Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/maps-static/intro)
   - [Socrata Open Data API](https://dev.socrata.com/)
   - [NASA API (Check out DEMO_KEY Rate Limits)](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html)
   - [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)
   - [Wordnik API](https://developer.wordnik.com/)
   - [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/)
   - [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/)
   - [Yoda (and other dialects) Translation API](http://funtranslations.com/api#yoda)
   - [Random Cat Images API](http://thecatapi.com/)
   - [National Nutrition Database API](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/api/doc)
   - ...or [find another API here!](https://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory)
   - ...or [here](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)!
   - ...or [here](https://any-api.com/)!
   - ...or [here](https://2018-asc-secret.glitch.me/)!
3. Requirements:
   - The website should be responsive and work properly on a mobile device:
     - The target device is iPhone5 (320x568)
   - The website should include 2 or more event handlers
   - The website must be properly hosted on GitHub
4. First, Brainstorm the concept for your website and present your idea to your instructors, making sure to outline:
   - Which API’s you’re using and how they’ll work together
   - What each person is doing
5. If it is not approved, make any necessary revisions and try again
6. Once approved, make your wireframes:
   - Remember, there should be a desktop and a mobile wireframe
   - You do NOT need your instructor's approval here, however, it’s beneficial to you to ask for their advice and input.
7. You may begin creating!
   - *Note: Be kind to the API server(s)! You’re cohort has 20 students all requesting information (likely from the same IP address). Don’t spam refresh your browser or loop 100 individual requests - this can get your IP address blacklisted!*
   - *Note: Again, at this point I’m expecting your projects to be both functional and looking visually polished. Do your best!*

## Extra Credit
- Incorporate Firebase as a way of keeping track of information previously used by users
   - Your website should be able to display this previous information
